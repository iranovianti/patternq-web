# patternq-web
React-based frontend for PatternQ, a deep learning tool for quantifying subcellular fluorescence pattern changes from microscopy images.  
It provides an interactive interface for model selection, scoring, and result export.

## Workflow
1. **Define Patterns** — Choose predefined patterns, or train the PatternQ model to learn new ones.
2. **Score Patterns** — Upload images to obtain quantitative pattern scores.
